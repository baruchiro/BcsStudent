# Blog Content Guidelines

## About The Blog
My blog, mainly about programming, in Hebrew.
Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel, based on Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog.

## RTL and Direction Guidelines

The blog is primarily in Hebrew and follows RTL (Right-to-Left) conventions:
1. Navigation arrows should point left (‚Üê) for "forward" actions
1. Use DirectionWrapper component for proper text direction handling
1. Text should be written in Hebrew

## Tag Management Guidelines

Current tags statistics are available in the `src/app/tag-data.json` file.

## General Rules

1. Each item (blog post/project) should have between 2-5 tags
2. Tags should be specific and relevant to the main topics of the content
3. Use existing tags when possible instead of creating new ones
4. Tags should be lowercase and use hyphens for spaces

## Tag Cleanup Guidelines

1. Regularly review and consolidate similar tags
2. Remove tags that are used only once unless highly specific and necessary
3. Merge tags that mean the same thing
4. Remove overly generic tags that don't add value
