If I have to click "See More..." one more time, I think I will scream.
But I will have to, so I'll try not to really scream.
I wish there was a way to tell the internet that I always want to "See More".  I don't ever want to not "See more".  Ever.  I always want to see more. Why would I ever want to "see less"?
